# CheckItOut
CheckItOut is an RFID-based Library Management System designed to make borrowing, returning, and tracking books easier. Each book has a unique code to enter in the system. The system also helps librarians keep track of books, find misplaced ones, and manage inventory more efficiently. CheckItOut saves time for both library staff and users while making the whole process smoother.

This is not yet a finished project. This is project is focused on creating the front-end of the website and the back-end such as database doesn't work yet.
